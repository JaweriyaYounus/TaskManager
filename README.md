 üß± Microservices Architecture

The application consists of the following services:

1. Frontend Service (React.js)
   - Displays the UI to manage tasks.
   - Communicates with the API Gateway.

2. API Gateway (Node.js + Express)
   - Routes requests to the appropriate backend services.
   - Handles authentication and rate limiting (optional).

3. Task Service (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)
   - Handles task CRUD operations.
   - Stores data in MongoDB.

4. Database (MongoDB)
   - Stores task records.
